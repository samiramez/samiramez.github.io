                        <p>Morse code is a method of communication that uses a series of dots and dashes to represent letters and numbers. 
                            Developed in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail, Morse code was originally designed for use in telegraph 
                            communication, but has since been used in various other applications, including aviation, navigation, and amateur
                             radio.

                             collecting food items and growing in length as it does so. The objective of the game is to keep the snake from crashing into the walls or its own body,
                              while continuing to collect food and increasing the player's score. The game usually gets progressively more difficult as the snake grows longer, making it

                        <p>A keylogger is a type of malicious software or hardware that records every keystroke made by a computer user, usually without their knowledge or consent.
                             The purpose of a keylogger is often to gather sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal messages, which can then be used for
                              fraudulent purposes, such as identity theft or financial fraud. Keyloggers can be installed on a computer by an attacker through various means, such as through a phishing email,
